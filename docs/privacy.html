        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how MultiFlow ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and
          shares information when you use the MultiFlow mobile application and related services.

        </p>
        <h3>2.2 Subscription and Purchase Data</h3>
        <p>
          For MultiFlow Pro subscriptions, purchase status and entitlement data may be processed by
          third-party billing and subscription providers (such as Apple and RevenueCat) to manage
          access.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Usage and Device Data</h3>
        <p>
          We may collect diagnostic and analytics data, including app version, crash logs, and
          interaction data to improve reliability and features.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>

        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain information only as long as needed to provide services, comply with legal
